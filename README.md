This repo contains an editor built with [Microsoft MakeCode (PXT)](https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt). 

## Local server setup

This setup gives you a local version of the editor and the ability to load packages from your machine. This is the setup to develop new packages.

### Setup

* install [Node.js 8+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* clone https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt-arcade to ``pxt-arcade`` folder. For example, from a git bash,

```
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt-arcade
```

* go to ``pxt-arcade`` and run

```
cd pxt-arcade
npm install
```

Don't forget to periodically ``git pull`` and ``npm install`` to get the latest changes.

```
git pull
npm install
```

### Launching the server

This command launches a local web server. Note that this web server is meant for development purposes only. It was not designed or secured to be run on a web server.

```
npm run serve
```

### Developing an Image resource package

## Local Dev setup

These instructions allow you to test changes to pxt-core and pxt-common-packages. They are more involved
as you need to clone and link 3 repos.

* install Node.js 8+
* (optional) install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* install the **pxt** command line tool

```
[sudo] npm install -g pxt
```

In a common folder,

* clone https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt to ``pxt`` folder
* clone https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt-common-packages to ``pxt-common-packages`` folder
* clone https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt-arcade to ``pxt-arcade`` folder
* go to ``pxt`` and run

```
npm install
npm run build
```

* then install the ``pxt`` command line tool (only need to do this once):

```
npm install -g pxt
```

* go to ``pxt-common-packages`` and run

```
npm install
npm link ../pxt
```

* go to ``pxt-arcade`` and run

```
npm install
npm link ../pxt
npm link ../pxt-common-packages
```

## to run the local server

From root github folder,

```
cd pxt-arcade
pxt serve
```
in the folder you wish to update.
