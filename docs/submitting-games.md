# Submitting Games

When you've made a game that your proud of, you can submit it on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt-arcade) for the chance to have it added to the homescreen.

First, fork the [PXT Arcade](https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt-arcade) repository, and copy your game into a new file in the ``docs/community`` folder using either the [Blocks](/community/blocks-template) or [JavaScript](/community/javascript-template) template.

After doing this, commit the game and push it to a branch in your fork. On GitHub, make a pull request from your branch to the ``master`` branch on pxt-arcade using the ``Game Submission`` template.
