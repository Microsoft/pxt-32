# Wires

## Prepping the buttons

For each of the buttons, 

- [ ] connect the JST button connector cable. Those are the cables that came with your Arcade game kit and end with a white square plastic connector (named JST connector)

- [ ] insert 2 male jumper wires into the JST connector

- [ ] secure the male jumper with some electrical tape. Make sure to pull hard on the tape to stretch it as you tape it.

- [ ] Using the wire stripper, strip one of the female jumper wire (strip around 1/2" or 1cm)

Repeat this process for the 7 arcade buttons.

- [ ] grab the 7 **stripped** jumper wires and thread them together. Use electrical tape to keep the cables together.

- [ ] strip the **male** connector of a jumper wire and thread it around the bundle of you just created. Use electrical tape to secure it all.

### ~ hint

If you have access to a soldering iron, we strongly recommend to add a bit of solder on the threaded cables to guarantee a great electrical connection.

## Prepping the joysticks

For each of joysticks,

- [ ] connect the joystick cable on **COM** and **NO** terminals.

- [ ] connect 2 jumper wires to the JST connector
- [ ] strip one jumper wire for each connector

Repeat these steps for the 4 connectors of the joystick.

### ~ hint

You can use small zip ties to bundle cables together and avoid a spaghetti-like mess of wires.

- [ ] join the 4 stripped jumper wire into a bundle

- [ ] strip the **male** connector of a jumper wire and connect it to the bundle
