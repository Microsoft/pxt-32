You will also need to cutout the 2 side of the arcade.

## Cut Instructions

* start by cutting and mitering all the cuts set aside
* cutout the 2 profiles of the arcade. Once you have a side, you can use it as a template to cut out the other one (using a router)

## Assembly instructions

* create 2 jigs that lets you position boards 1/4' from the side
* cutout various 1' x 1/2' slides of boards needed to secure the boards.

For each board, 

* cutout 2 slices and glue/pin them to the side
* use the jib to position the boards 1/4' from the sides.

Once all the boards are secured, secure the upper side of the arcade and you're done!

## Control panel

Follow the wiring instructions of the [cardboard control panel](/hardware/raspberry-pi/cardboard-control-panel) to wire the buttons and joysticks to the raspberry pi.

## Screen

* place the screen on the wood panel and mark the position where the screen touches the wood.
* pin nail attachments to squeeze the screen
* drill holes to allow power and HDMI cables to pass through the back of the screen

To make it easier, we recommend building a jib to position build this part.
