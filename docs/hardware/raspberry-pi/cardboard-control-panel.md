## Materials

Let's go through the materials and tools needed to build the control panel.

### ~ hint

Just like any cooking recipe, you will likely be missing some of the tools or parts.
Don't let this stop you! This guide provides a general guidance but you can complete the project in 
many different ways.

### Parts

* **a cardboard box** that will become the control panel. If you are buying a PC monitor to build the Arcade,
use the box of the monitor.
* **2 joysticks & 7 buttons** for a 2 players OR **1 joystick & 5 buttons** for 1 player. Search for "Arcade Game Kit" to find a kit near you (stay away from the LED buttons and the analog joysticks).
* **33 Male-to-Female jumper wires** to connect the buttons to the Raspberry Pi. Buy a few more in case you make a mistake.
* **electrical tape** to secure the jumper wires to the arcade button connectors.
* **zip ties** to secure the joysticks; you can also use machine screws if you have some at hand.
* **Raspberry Pi Zero Kit** with Raspberry Pi Zero (Wifi/BLE not required), HDMI cable, power supply, memory card (not all kits have one).

### Tools

* **cardboard cutting tools**: scissors, rotary cutters, carboard knife. You'll need something to cut into the cardboard. (Our favorite is the Canary Yellow Knife).
* **wire stripper, cutter** to cut and strip some of the jumper wires.
* **crayon or sharpie** to mark where to drill.
* **Glue gun** (optional): if you make a mistake, a glue gun can easily save the day. Optional but recommended.
* **1 inch drill bit + cordless drill** (optional): while you can drill the button holes with a manual tool, the 1" drill bit is the best at making a clean hole for the buttons. Recommended.
