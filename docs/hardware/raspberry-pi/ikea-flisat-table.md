### Materials

From your local IKEA,

* an [**IKEA FLISAT**](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/flisat-childrens-table-50298418/) from your local IKEA 
* **2 IKEA TROFAST** storage boxes.

From your electronics shop,

* A two player arcade kit: **2 joysticks** and **7 buttons** (avoid using any LED buttons or analog joysticks).
* **2 mini breadboards**
* **Male-to-Male and Male-to-Female jumper wires** to connect the buttons to the Raspberry Pi (see later in this list).
* **Raspberry Pi Zero Kit** with a [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/) (Wifi/BLE not required), HDMI adapter, power supply, memory card (not all kits have one).
* **Computer monitor** with HDMI input and HDMI cable.

From your hardware store,

* **Electrical tape** to secure the jumper wires to the arcade button connectors.
* **Machine screws and bolts** to secure the joysticks.
* **Small screws** to secure the panels.

### Tools

* **Crayon or sharpie** to mark where to drill.
* **1 1/8 inch drill bit + cordless drill** (optional): while you can drill the button holes with a manual tool, the 1 1/8" drill bit is the best at making a clean hole for the buttons. It's recommended that you use a drill if you have one and can use it safely.
* **Scissors or cutting tool**: to cut a hole in the TROFAST storage boxes.
