### Materials

* an [**IKEA FLISAT**](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/flisat-childrens-table-50298418/) from your local IKEA with 2 TROFAST storage boxes.
* **2 joysticks** and **6 buttons** for a 2 players OR **1 joystick** and **4 buttons** for 1 player, plus **1 button** as an extra, optional RESET button. Search for "Arcade Game Kit" to find a kit near you as a source for parts (avoid using any LED buttons or analog joysticks).
* **2 mini breadboard**
* **Male-to-Male and Male-to-Female jumper wires** to connect the buttons to the Raspberry Pi (see later in this list). Buy a few more if you can in case you make a mistake.
* **Electrical tape** to secure the jumper wires to the arcade button connectors.
* **Machine screws and bolts** to secure the joysticks.
* **Small screws** to secure the panels.
* **Raspberry Pi Zero Kit** with a [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/) (Wifi/BLE not required), HDMI cable, power supply, memory card (not all kits have one).

### Tools

* **Drill or impact drill**: 
* **Wire stripper, cutter** to cut and strip some of the jumper wires.
* **Crayon or sharpie** to mark where to drill.
* **1 1/8 inch drill bit + cordless drill** (optional): while you can drill the button holes with a manual tool, the 1 1/8" drill bit is the best at making a clean hole for the buttons. It's recommended that you use a drill if you have one and can use it safely.
