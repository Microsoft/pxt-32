From what we learned in the previous lessons we should be able to make some great games. 

1. Generate several game ideas (at least 3) and discuss with another student on what is good and what can be improved.
2. Pick the game to be built and design a simplest version of that game to start with. We call this a MVP or Minimum Viable Product.  It is the simplest version of a a product that has some working features.
3.  Make the MVP fast - not perfect.  Test it and show it to others for feedback.  Decide which features you will add to the game.  
4. Use at least **10** of the following in creating a game:
  * Sprites
  * Position (coordinates)
  * Controller (dx) (vx)
  * Overlap Events / sprite kind
  * "spawn" create / on create
  * Random
  * Showing numbers as string
  * Score / life (info)
  * Timer (countdown)
  * Flip
  * Stay in screen / ghost
  * Set image
  * Function
  * Sprite say
  * Splash
5. Repeat with another game if time allows or instructor assigns you to design and produce multiple games.

## What did we learn? 

1. What did you learn making a MVP version of the game?  What was useful and what was difficult?
2. Which items in the list of 15 things to use in the game were not used?  Why?  If all were used explain which ones were essential to the game verses non-essential or less useful.

## Rubrics - one for each game project produced

### Project task rubric
