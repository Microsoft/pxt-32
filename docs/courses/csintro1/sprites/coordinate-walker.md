# Activity: Coordinate Walker

Move walker sprite around the game screen to identify X-Y coordinates

In this Activity students investigate the game screen using
* Game X, Y Coordinates  

## Concept: Identify the X, Y coordinates of the Game Screen

In order to create games we need to place Sprites and other objects at various locations on the Game Screen.  In this set of activities we will relate the screen `(x, y)` coordinates to the 4 corners and middle of the game screen

## Student Activity

* [Use the coordinate walker example to get X and Y coordinates.](#coordinate-walker)
* [Determine **X** and **Y** coordinates for the corners and middle of the the game screen.](#map-game-screen)
* [Record Results in simple diagram](#record-results)

### Coordinate Walker

Use the coordinate walker example to move around the screen and track X and Y coordinates.

**Open [coordinate walker program](https://makecode.com/_Vdi18F33t66F)**: to compete the tasks


* **Check the location**: Run the program and then press the "A" button on the game pad (or space bar key on keyboard) to display the starting location coordinates - press to see x and y coordinates.
  * Note the two coordinate values for (x,y)
* **Move the sprite**: click on the game pad (or use keyboard a, w, s, d keys) to move the sprite.  Check the coordinates after moving.
    
## What did we learn?
Use **X** and/or **Y** in your answers  

1. Describe how coordinates change when moving up versus moving down  
2. Describe how coordinates change when moving right versus moving left  

### Map Game Screen

Two dimensional game screen coordinates are represented by values for **X** and **Y** axis locations.

* Move to the sprite to the top edge of the screen
  * what is the **Y** coordinate at the top of the screen?  
  ![sprite at top edge of screen](/static/courses/csintro1/sprites/coordinate-edge.png)

* Move to each of the corners and **map the coordinates** as a pair of X and Y values like `(x,y)`
    * Restart the game. What are the coordinates when you start? Should be `(64,64)`.
    * **Record** the coordinates at the **Top Right** corner  
    * **Record** the coordinates at the **Bottom Right** corner  
    * **Record** the coordinates at the **Bottom Left** corner  
    * **Record** the coordinates at the **Top Left** corner   
    * **Record** the Game Screen Dimensions (height by width)

### Challenge

**Bring off-screen sprite back into view.**
 Challenge a peer to bring the sprite back into view after you move the sprite off screen.

1. **Partner 1:** Move the walker sprite off past the area of the visible game screen (not too far)
2. **Partner 2**: Return the sprite to the screen using only two directions of the game controls
    * use the game pad **A** button to get the *hidden* sprite coordinates
    * pick 1: `up` or `down` Y direction
    * pick 1: `left` or `right`  X direction
    * using only the controller pad keys chosen bring the sprite back onto the screen.

## Rubrics

### ~hint

Start on the left rubric column (5pts), if the work meets the rubric measurement continue to the right (7pts, 9pts, 10pts). Award the score of the right most rubric that is passed.  This means that to get the highest score, student must pass all previous rubrics.
