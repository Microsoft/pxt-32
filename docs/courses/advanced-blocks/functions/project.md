# Activity: Functions Project

Make games of your choosing!

From what we learned in the previous lessons we should be able to make some great games.

### Concepts Learned
* ``||loops:update every ||`` loop
* ``||loops:repeat||`` or ``||loops:for||`` loop
* Position (set or change coordinates)
* Controller (dx) and ``||controller:control sprite with||``
* Overlap Events / sprite kind
* Random
* Showing numbers as string
* Score / life
* Countdown
* Flip
* Stay in screen
* ghost
* Set image
* Sprite say
* Splash
* create / on create
* Math (multiply, divide, add, or subtract)
* set background color
* functions that sets up a sprite
* functions called from more than one place
* extensions

## Student Task #1: Initial Ideas
1. Think of 3 ideas for a game that you would like to make that use some of these concepts learned
2. On a piece of paper, sketch out what each game will look like
3. Discuss your ideas with a partner. Talk about what you each like about the ideas and what you don't like
4. Discuss with your partner about what features would need to be implemented for each game


## Student Task #2: MVP
An MVP, or Minimum Viable Product is what we call the simplest version of a product that has some working features. The idea is that you make a very simple foundation for your product and that you consistently add in features while getting feedback from users.

1. Pick one of your ideas that you want to turn into a full game
2. Identify what crucial functionality is required for the game. Think about what the one thing about your game that makes it unique is
3. Make a list of these key features that you need to implement
4. Transition into the development cycle and start making your game

### ~hint

For an MVP game, you might want to avoid spending too much time getting bogged down making the perfect image for your sprite; instead, you can always just use some of the pre-made sprites in the Gallery - that way you can focus on getting the concept for your game into a functional state, and personalize it later on!

## Student Task #3: Development Cycle

This is the development process we will use to turn an idea into a finished product. It works by adding small changes and getting feedback as you develop. When you get to the end of the Learn section, if there are ideas that you would still like to implement, circle back to the Build section and start implementing those ideas.

Repeat until your game has at least **7** items from the list of Concepts Learned, you have at least **2** functions in your game, **and** you are satisfied with your project. If more time is available, make a MVP for another one of your original ideas and begin the development cycle on it.

> ### Build
> We will implement a list of features
> 1. Break down what tasks need to be down for each feature you want to implement
> 2. Make a plan for how each one of tasks will get done
> 3. Complete the tasks needed to implement these features
>
>
> ### Measure
> We will gather feedback about our game from an outside source
> 1. Find someone to test your current build with
> 2. Give a 15-30 second pitch of what your game is supposed to be
> 3. Have them play your game
> 4. Get their feedback. What do they like about the game? What would they like to be improved? How would they like it to be improved?
>
>
> ### Learn
> We will interpret our feedback into a list of features that we want to implement
> 1. Reflect on the feedback you got from users testing your game
> 2. Think about what features you would like to add based on what users want
> 3. Prioritize what features are most important to implement


## What did we learn?

1. Describe a feature of this game that you would like to work on further and ideas for implementation.
2. List the names of the functions you used. Describe for each function name, why it has a good descriptive name and/or how the function name could be improved.
