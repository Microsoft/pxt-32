# CS Intro

A collection of courses meant to teach introductory programmers using Blocks and JavaScript

These courses are currently in beta - this means that they are likely to have bugs and changes made fairly regularly. If you see anything that doesn't seem quite right, or if you have any suggestions, please file an issue on [github](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-arcade).
