# Learn MakeCode Arcade - Teacher Information

## Welcome! 

This beginning game design experience has been crafted specifically for students between the ages of 12 & 17. Everyone is welcome to give it a try, but the language-level and pace is intended to guide middle and high school students through an entry-level experience without the need for a classroom environment.
