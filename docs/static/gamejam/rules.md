## Garden Jam

The theme for this jam is "gardens". In other words, we're looking for games about gardening or set in a garden-like environment. Some possible ways to interpret this theme:

1. A farming simulator where you plant, nurture, and harvest crops
2. An exploration game starring a bee that must travel from flower to flower and pollinate a garden
3. A stealth game where you play as a rabbit swiping carrots from an unsuspecting farmer

You can interpret "gardens" however you want, but someone playing your game should be able to see how it relates to the theme without extra explanation.
