## Heist Jam

The theme for this jam is "heists". In other words, we're looking for games about *stealing* things. Some possible ways to interpret this theme:

1. A stealth game where you avoid security guards and pilfer paintings inside of a museum at night
2. A flying game where you control a magpie as they swipe shiny objects from an unsuspecting neighborhood
3. A tower defense game where you place security cameras and infrared lasers to thwart thieves

You can interpret "heists" however you want, but someone playing your game should be able to see how it relates to the theme without extra explanation.

## Duration
**Start:** June 1, 2020  
**End:** June 30, 2020

You will have a month to build and submit your games for the competition!  For you procrastinators out there, we will accept games up until 11:59pm on June 30th
