## Time Jam

The theme for this jam is "time". In other words, we're looking for games with day-night cycles, countdown clocks, or other time-based mechanics. Here are some examples of how you could use this theme:

You can interpret "time" however you want, but someone playing your game should be able to see how it relates to the theme without extra explanation.

## Duration
The game jam will run from **May 3**, 2021 to **May 17**, 2021

You will have roughly two weeks to build and submit your games for the competition! For you procrastinators out there, we will accept games up until 11:59pm on May 17th.

## Rules

1. Games should be built in MakeCode Arcade
2. Your game must relate to the jam theme. Someone playing your game should be able to see how it relates to the theme without extra explanation.
3. Keep the games PG: no NSFW, offensive, or excessively violent content.
4. You must be at least 9 years old to participate.
5. All games must be submitted by someone who is at least 13 years old. Younger students are welcome to participate, but it must be in partnership with an adult and with parent permission.

## Speculate Together

This game jam is designed to be an easy introduction to making games, even for folks without prior programming experience! We highly encourage parents and educators to work with interested students to bring their games to life.
