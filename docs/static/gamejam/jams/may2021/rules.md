## ?????? Jam

That's right! We're keeping this one a secret. We'll be announcing the theme and full rules a week before the jam starts on this page. Make sure you check back in!

## Duration
The game jam will run from **May 3**, 2021 to **May 17**, 2021

You will have roughly two weeks to build and submit your games for the competition! For you procrastinators out there, we will accept games up until 11:59pm on May 17th.

## No experience needed!

## Rules

1. Games should be built in MakeCode Arcade
2. Your game must relate to the jam theme. Someone playing your game should be able to see how it relates to the theme without extra explanation.
3. Keep the games PG: no NSFW, offensive, or excessively violent content.
4. You must be at least 9 years old to participate.
5. All games must be submitted by someone who is at least 13 years old. Younger students are welcome to participate, but it must be in partnership with an adult and with parent permission.
