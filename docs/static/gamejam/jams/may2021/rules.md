## ?????? Jam

That's right! We're keeping this one a secret. We'll be announcing the theme and full rules a week before the jam starts on this page. Make sure you check back in!

## Duration
The game jam will run from **May 3**, 2021 to **May 17**, 2021

You will have roughly two weeks to build and submit your games for the competition! For you procrastinators out there, we will accept games up until 11:59pm on May 17th.
