## Traffic Jam

The theme for this jam is "traffic". In other words, we're looking for games about cars, roads, or travel! Some example of games might include:

1. A delivery service game where you need to find the fastest route through a city to your destination
2. A game where you helm an air traffic control tower and guide planes between landing strips
3. An ant simulator where you lay trail pheromones to establish efficient routes between picnic food and an anthill

You can interpret "traffic" however you want, but someone playing your game should be able to see how it relates to the theme without extra explanation.

## Carpool Together

MakeCode Arcade brings programming to life for students of all ages. Create fun projects, get immediate feedback, and code using either drag-and-drop blocks or text programming!

This game jam is designed to be an easy introduction to making games, even for folks without prior programming experience! We highly encourage parents and educators to work with interested students to bring their games to life.
