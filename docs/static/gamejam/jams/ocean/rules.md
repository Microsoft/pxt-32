## Ocean Jam

The theme for this jam is "ocean". In other words, we're looking for games about oceans, beaches, or marine life (freshwater fish need not apply). Here are some examples of how you could use this theme:

1. A deep sea exploration game where you pilot a remote submarine that's searching for shipwrecks
2. A surfing game where you do sick stunts to impress a panel of judges
3. A game where you play as the moon and control the tides to guide ships to shore

You can interpret "ocean" however you want, but someone playing your game should be able to see how it relates to the theme without extra explanation.

## Ship off together

MakeCode Arcade brings programming to life for students of all ages. Create fun projects, get immediate feedback, and code using either drag-and-drop blocks or text programming!
This game jam is designed to be an easy introduction to making games, even for folks without prior programming experience! We highly encourage parents and educators to work with interested students to bring their games to life.
